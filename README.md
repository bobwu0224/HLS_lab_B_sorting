 ## Insertion sort
 - Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. 

 - It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. 

 - advantages:
   - Simple implementation
   - Efficient for (quite) small data sets
   - only requires a constant amount O(1) of additional memory space   

 ## Merge sort
 - Merge sort is an efficient, general-purpose, and comparison-based sorting algorithm.

 - advantages:
   - The same amount of data with the same number of running cycles
   - Efficient for (quite) large data sets

 ## build flow
 1. Study algorithms
 2. Write C++ code and verify on HLS
 3. Use vivado for block design
 4. Run on pynq
